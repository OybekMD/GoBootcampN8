GET TIME of select by id query 
explain analyze select * from table_name where id = 10000;


//BTREE -> binary tree 
it searchs like binary search
example of heap
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-data-structure/

if we gonna get only id BTREE work fast but if we wanna get name it'll work slower than id !!!
check them under querys
explain analyze select id from table_name where id = 10000;
explain analyze select name from table_name where id = 10000;

select the name which is a column in the table it's not the column is not in the index it's in the table it's the heap it's a 
    different data structure

~SECOND~
if we use this query againg we get faster than last time since <CASHING>


-----------
SERACH BY NAME 
if we search by name 
it'll be realy slow which geting data from db
explain analyze select id from table_name where name = 'Zs';
